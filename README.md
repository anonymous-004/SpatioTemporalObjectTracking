# SpatioTemporalObjectTracking
Graph translation network for modeling spatio-temporal dynamics of household objects for our paper 'Proactive Robot Assistance via Spatio-Temporal Object Modeling'. The model reads in an input graph representing the environment and time, and translates it to a probabilistic output graph representing the environment at the next time step.

### Running this model
To run the model on the existing dataset, you can use the `run.py` with the path to the dataset and config file. e.g. `python3 ./run.py --path=$dataset`. To run a batch using existing configuration with baselines and ablations, use `runRoutines.sh`. The dataset should be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wJ3wUdd0E0RuoLJcp-a7LmGWGn7uIPTE?usp=sharing) into the root directory (creating the structure `SpatioTemporalObjectTracking/data/persona/...`) in order to run on that dataset.

A processed version of the [HOMER dataset]() used for the results is present in the `data/` directory of this repository, and can be used directly with the model using the above commands. In order to use a different dataset generated using HOMER, first copy the dataset into `data/` directory, and then run `prepRoutines.sh` to run the necessary pre-processing. This needs to be done only once.

If you're curious about the code itself:
- The model and it's helper functions can be found in `GraphTranslatorModule.py`
- The `reader.py` file contains code to process the (HOMER) dataset
- The evaluation functions for our model are in `breakdown_evaluations.py`
